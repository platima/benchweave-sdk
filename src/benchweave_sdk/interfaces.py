    A plugin exposes a no-argument ``create_plugin()`` factory (named by

    binds descriptor and services, ``execute`` runs one operation,
    ``next_event`` polls a subscription, and ``close`` releases the
    session. Construction and ``open`` stay free of device I/O; each
    session uses a fresh adapter instance.

    Examples
    --------
    A minimal read-only adapter skeleton:

    ```{.python}
    class DemoAdapter:
        async def open(self, descriptor, services, context): ...
